* **Dependency Injection (DI)** -- -- The technology that Spring is identified with is Dependency Injection flavor of Inversion of Control. Inversion of Control (IoC) is the general concept and Dependency Injection is merely one concrete example of Inversion of Control. What is Dependency Injection exactly? Let's look at two words separately. *Dependency* is the association between two classes. For example, class A is dependent of class B. Now look at the second part *injection*. All this means is, class B will be injected to class A by the IoC.
* **Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)** --
