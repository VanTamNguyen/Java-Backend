# Java backend
Things I have to learn to become a backend engineer using Java

## Frameworks

* Spring boot in action

* Hibernate in action

## Build systems

## Profiles

## Basic database

## Basic security

## RESTful resources
#### 1. Definition
* The mistake that's often made when approaching REST is
 to think of it as *web services with URLs*
* REST is resource-oriented, emphasizing the things and
nouns that describe the application
* REST (REpresentational State Transfer)
    * **Representational**: REST resources can be represented in any virtually form,
    including XML, JSON or even HTML, whatever forms best suits
    the consumers of those resources
    * **State**: When working with REST, we are more concerned 
    with state of resources than with the actions we take against
    resources

## Test
#### 1. Unit test
#### 2. Integration test
